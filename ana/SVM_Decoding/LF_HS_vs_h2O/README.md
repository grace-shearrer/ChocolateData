Find **jupyter notebooks** [here](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks) with code explanation and outputs, the [images](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks/images) directory is here too and holds the SVM weight images (.png).  
* [4waves_decoding.ipynb](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/blob/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks/4waves_decoding.ipynb) - this is the code and result of decoding on LF_HS vs. h2O using subjects that completed 4 waves. This data is divided into two parts for faster processing.   
* [wave1_decoding.ipynb](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/blob/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks/wave1_decoding.ipynb) - this is the code and result of decoding on LF_HS vs. h2O using subjects that completed wave 1.
* [view_niftis.ipynb](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/blob/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks/view_niftis.ipynb) - how we can look at decoding images in FSL
* [nifti images](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/blob/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/niftis.zip) - zip file containing decoded (.nii) files, also available on RENCI

Batch jobs (.job) and individual image (.py)  [code](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/code) can be found [here.](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/code)
