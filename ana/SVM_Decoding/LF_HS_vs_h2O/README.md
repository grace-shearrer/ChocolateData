Find jupyter notebooks [here](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks) with code explanation and outputs, the [images](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/notebooks/images) directory is here too and holds the SVM weight images (.png). 

Batch jobs (.job) and individual image (.py)  [code](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/code) can be found [here.](https://github.com/niblunc/ChocolateData/tree/master/ana/SVM_Decoding/LF_HS_vs_h2O/code)
